This bookmarklet helps you copy and paste robocaller info from Gmail (specifically, from Google Voice transcripts) into the donotcall.gov complaint form.

To use it:
-create a new bookmark, but instead of an address paste in the javascript contained in bookmarklet.js, replacing the phone number 9999999999 with your number
-open a Google Voice transcript email in Gmail
-click the bookmarklet three times (the first click will copy the robocaller phone number, date, time, and voicemail transcript from the Gmail message on screen and bring up the donotcall.gov complaint form step #1; the second click will fill in the step #1 form and advance to step #2; the third click will complete the step #2 form and submit the complaint)
